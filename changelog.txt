Major:
- Added "spell scrolls" to all dungeons. These are "pre-paid" spells with limited uses intended to introduce players to the spell system.
- Changed how spell power sources work. You now select a power source to cast a spell with by holding "R", and dragging to a power source.
- New spell delivery methods:
    - Imbue: This allows you to create your own spell scrolls that you can use yourself or share with others.
    - Cone: Delivers the spell to blocks in front of you in a cone shape.
- New spell effects:
    - Sonic Disruption: Allows players to play a sound at a position. It doesn't allow playing music or interface sounds.
    - Summon Arrow: Allows players to shoot an arrow into the world.
- New spell power sources:
    - Lunar: This will charge up overnight, and dissipate during the day.
    - Solar: This will charge up during the day, and dissipate overnight.
    - Thermal: This will charge up while around warm things like torches, lava, and deserts. It will dissipate in tundras, and while around ice and snow.
    - Leech: This will consume nearby living things like mobs and nature to cast spells.
    - Innate: This charges up over time with a very limited maximum. Unlocked from the start.
- Added a "Frost Phoenix" mini-boss and perch structure. It currently does not unlock any researches, but more will be added here soon!
- Added eldritch metal tools, armor, and weapons. These negatively effect you when you don't kill something for 5 minutes.

Minor:

- Improved the smoke screen effect look
- Made desert fruit restore innate vitae when consumed
- Added JEI support (you can see recipes now!)
