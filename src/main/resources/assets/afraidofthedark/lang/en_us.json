From what I've seen so far from working with it, it appears to be otherworldly in origin. It also appears that I am the only one who can read it. I suspect that the notes I write in it are stored in an extra-dimensional location and then projected into my mind when I look at the pages. I further suspect that if I were to lose track of this journal, I could just look for a replacement and it would still contain all of my original notes and research. I have decided to organize my research in different sections based on relevance. I am certain that new opportunities will open themselves to me as I uncover more information. I can also return to the research tree by clicking the bookmark below. Additionally, I can run into others' research in the wilderness. This will take the form of research scrolls. Simply finding these scrolls and reading them will let me copy their notes into my own journal. Sometimes, there will be multiple multiple parts to a scroll and it will be labelled as such eg: part seven of nine. Sometimes, there may be stories or histories coming in multiple volumes which also contain hints for future researches.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.blade_of_exhumation.text": "I have devised a sword specifically for fighting enchanted skeletons. When they die normally, they drop three bones and seeing as they require 4 bones to reform, I have to fight them over and over. For example, if I were to kill one hundred enchanted skeletons, seventy-five would reform. If I killed seventy-five of them, fifty-six would reform and so on. This blade ensures a one-shot kill on enchanted skeletons and makes them drop 4 bones, meaning I can easily use it to grind enchanting levels until the sword runs out of charge. The sword can be crafted with a single diamond to recharge it. The sword contains enough energy for one hundred fifty uses and after that, it becomes inert until recharged.",

I'd run faster, but I'm iron clad. I just wish it wasn't so useless! This really is killing my hubris. To thy own self me true. Yes, people like you! Oh piss off you old man Confucius! The crossbow just needs an upgrade. With someone, maybe I could trade. Except not a village, the last one I pillaged, and they always need to be paid.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.phylactery_of_souls.pre_text": "If my ideas are correct regarding werewolves' regenerative powers, then I should be able to make my next creation using a portion of their blood.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.phylactery_of_souls.text": "My theory was correct! Werewolves are immortal! Even if killed, they will simply regenerate somewhere else in the land. This must be part of the reason they are so powerful; some werewolves could be ancient and very intelligent! The blood of a werewolf traps the creatures soul, making it unable to die. Even if its body is destroyed, its soul will be unable to pass on and will instead be forced into a new body. This begs the question: who is controlling the werewolves? Who is cursing them to forever wander in their beast form, unable to die? Anyways, I can use the soul trapping properties of werewolf blood to trap the souls of other creatures. By constructing a bottle or flask of the most valuable crystal and diamond and filling it with werewolf blood, I can create the phylactary of souls. When it's in my hotbar and I kill a creature, it binds to the soul type of that creature. Every kill made on the same creature type will steal more pieces of the creatures' souls, until enough fragments have been gathered to form an entire soul. Once enough kills have been made, the phylactery will turn blue and transparent and can be used to summon one of the same creature type every so often, effectively providing an endless supply of whatever creature I can repeatedly slay. I already know that elder guardians, ender dragons, and withers all have souls much too powerful to be captured in this method. If I want to clear a flask's memory I can craft it together with werewolf blood.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.void_chest.text": "After travelling through the massive underground chest, I think I have a clue as to how it works. If my theory is correct, it basically functions as a massive enderchest for people. I have devised a much smaller version of the large void chest. My newest creation is the same size as a regular chest. When opened, it will suck in the one who lifted its lid and draw them inside itself. If the void chest is destroyed, it can simply be replaced by another one without anything inside being lost, similar to an ender chest. The first person who activates a void chest will be its owner until it is broken, meaning unwanted guests cannot enter. However, if I want to enable a friend to visit the inside of my chest, I simply right click the void chest with a name tag that has the name of the friend on it. Trying to add a friend when they are already added will instead remove them. All void chests owned by one person will lead to the same location. Void chests owned by one person do not share a friend list and breaking a void chest will reset the owner and delete all friends on that particular chest.",

Sunstones can be combined with diamonds to create igneous gems, powerful crystals which contain trapped elemental fire within their latices. Igneous gems burn their holder severely, so caution must be taken handling them. I should invest in a good fire blanket... If igneous gems are gathered, they can be crafted into igneous armor, a powerful suit which renders the user impervious to damage from fire and resistant to lava. In addition, when wearing a full suit of igneous armor, the armor lights any attackers on fire, regardless of the attacks being ranged or physical. It will also knock attackers back making it an excellent tool against quick mobs. Igneous gems can also be made into a sword which lights enemies on fire. Striking enemies builds up a magical charge.

  "research.afraidofthedark.star_metal.text": "Upon rummaging around the insides of an asteroid, I have discovered a new material, which I have named starmetal. Starmetal ingots are made by smelting starmetal fragments. If starmetal ingots are combined with iron ingots, they can be made into starmetal plates, which can then be forged into various tools and armor. Starmetal armor provides superior protection to diamond, and gives the user an overshield which will absorb damage before the user. A starmetal khopesh gains energy upon striking an enemy. When it reaches maximum charge, it will begin to shimmer with arcane power. When at maximum charge, it can unleash a devastating area of effect slash by using right click. In addition to the khopesh, a staff can be made out of starmetal. Every so often, the wielder can activate the starmetal staff to jump on top of it, becoming invulnerable for several seconds, dodging everything from arrows to cataclysmic world-annihilating explosions as if you rolled a natural 20 on your dodge check. It should also be noted that star metal crossbow bolts will deal massive damage to werewolves.",

Splinter Drones are deadly with their rapid-fire plasma cannons and can easily mow down anything their perceive as a threat. Too bad they're fine with zombies and enchanted skeletons... I am sure that I will eventually be able to modify a drone's friend or foe identification, so that it will follow and protect me.

  "research.afraidofthedark.enarias_secret.text": "While the table before me looks quite incongruous, I can grasp the basics. After peering into the table it becomes apparent that this spell table resembles a mirror reflecting any spells I have created into my mind. I have the ability to forget spells, create new spells, edit spells, and fire off spells in various ways. *cough* key-bindings *cough* Editing spells looks about as complex as proving P = NP, but after some careful inspection the table becomes more distinguishable. I can easily name a spell whatever I desire. After probing the magical block, it would appear each spell requires a source of power to tap from to trigger the spell. It would also seem that each spell is divided into separate spell stages. Each spell stage is preceded by a delivery method. This delivery method defines how a given spell reaches its target. For example, a projectile flies through the air until it reaches its target. Once the delivery method reaches its destination, it applies any of the proceeding effects. As well as this, it will trigger the next spell stage's delivery method. The way in which the next delivery method is fired depends on the previous delivery method. After some tinkering I have discovered that sum of the cost of each spell stage adds up to the cost of the spell as a whole. How this cost is interpreted depends on the power source. I'm sure that further perusing of my surroundings in the overworld will help discover more spell effects, delivery methods, and power sources. Unfortunately, it currently appears that only whispers in the nightmare allow me to conjure up and edit new spells. I hope to find a way to do this in the comfort of my home at some point, since Enaria will always find me eventually in the Nightmare. If Enaria does manage to find me while I am spell crafting, any progress or work done on the current spell may be lost or distorted.",
