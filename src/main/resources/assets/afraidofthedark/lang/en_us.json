  "research.afraidofthedark.advanced_magic.pre_text": "In the great tower that overlooks the oasis, I can see a massive crystal hanging mid-air. Surely this must pertain to very powerful magic. I should go take a look.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.advanced_magic.text": "I'm beginning to understand. These crystals are essentially just large-scale versions of my own devices. They store massive amounts of Vitae for future use, and can be used by anyone in near proximity. This would have been immensely convenient to any spellcasters who lived here.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.alchemy.pre_text": "Astral silver is a great material for tools and weapons, however, I can't help but wonder if it could somehow be leveraged in spell casting. I'll revisit this idea when I'm more familiar with the subject.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.alchemy.text": "Aha! I just cast a spell using a Vitae lantern, and suddenly, I had a realization. Vitae lanterns are great and all, but they can only contain Vitae harvested from living things. What if I tried to cast spells directly from high-vitae materials like gold or astral silver? If this could work, the possibilities are endless!",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astral_silver.name": "Astral Silver",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astral_silver.tooltip": "silver of the moon",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astral_silver.pre_text": "I should try to ascertain the location of a fallen comet now I can use my telescope to track them. I grow ever more curious as to what these meteorites might contain.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astral_silver.text": "I have located one of the meteors, and it appears to contain a very unique material. It is still in ore form, and I must purify it. However, it almost resembles elemental silver, such as you might find underground. Although, I am suspicious that it may have some properties that far surpass that of normal silver. I should try and purify the metal for further research.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_1.name": "Astronomy 1",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_1.tooltip": "not astrology",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_1.pre_text": "Astronomy is the grandest of the sciences. It observes things happening on a scale much larger than we may ever comprehend. Included here is the recipe for a telescope that I found. If I craft it, perhaps I can begin my stargazing days anew.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_1.text": "The skies here are most interesting. I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, and I have also noticed a surprising amount of meteorites in the area. This must be what the ancient astronomers were so interested in. I must track down one of these comets using a sextant and investigate it thoroughly.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_2.name": "Astronomy 2",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_2.tooltip": "OP incoming",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_2.pre_text": "Astronomy has been a very useful tool to me so far, but I know my limits. There is nothing more in this field that I can learn on my own without spending decades on research, which I cannot afford to do. If I could perhaps find some sort of literature on the subject, I might be able to advance, but I feel like I have searched this realm quite extensively, yet no such information is to be found.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.astronomy_2.text": "The Nightmare Realm has been deeply disturbing, but, even here, I think I may have learned something. These scrolls seem to point to an entirely different type of comet. Using the hints that these writings provide, I might be able to spot these different types of comets using my telescope. As I consider the possibilities, my mind begins to race. Perhaps now I can find and research comets with materials even more exotic than astral silver.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.blood_magic.name": "Blood Magic",
  "research.afraidofthedark.blood_magic.tooltip": "this isn't wise",
  "research.afraidofthedark.blood_magic.pre_text": "I suspect there are more magical power sources to be obtained as I further explore this world. However, until I can cast spells of my own, many of them will remain a mystery to me.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.blood_magic.text": "It's so obvious now. As soon as I felt the magic rushing through my body, I knew that I could use my own lifeblood as a power source. Every living thing contains energy, so why shouldn't I be able to use that for my spells? This new method is quite dangerous, and I must be careful not to overdo it, or else risk killing myself. However, this also has great potential to become an incredibly useful and convenient source of magical power.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bloodbath.name": "Bloodbath",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bloodbath.tooltip": "magic mishaps",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bloodbath.pre_text": "I will have to experiment with Blood Magic some more. It is a dangerous, yet tantalizing route of research. Surely, I can take my power to new heights with further study.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bloodbath.text": "I... am honestly not sure about this. This method of spellcasting is morally grey at best. I have found that I can directly use the Vitae of other life forms to power my spells. It is usually not lethal, but I had best tread carefully here. This is a dark path to go down, but possibly a source of incredible power.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_dust.tooltip": "useless powder",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_dust.pre_text": "Normal bones can be made into bone meal. Perhaps these bones can be used for the same purpose? Surely it wouldn't hurt to try.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_dust.text": "Well, I ground up some of the bones I got from the enchanted skeletons, and I got mixed results. It seems to have created a much drier substance that looks more like dust than bone meal. It doesn't appear to help plants grow, but maybe it will have some other use. Certainly there is still some sort of magic in these bones. Perhaps this dust has magical properties as well.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_sword.name": "Bone Sword",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_sword.tooltip": "recycling your enemies",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_sword.pre_text": "Since the skeletons manage to apply some interesting effects to their opponents by merely hitting them, I wonder if I can replicate this effect and create a weapon of my own. I'll start by sharpening some of their bones, and attempting to create a sword out of them. I'll include my diagrams below.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.bone_sword.text": "Success! The Bone Sword has a number of unusual properties. For example, it applies a brief period of slowness and weakness to enemies, just like the skeletons do. As for its effects on the enchanted skeletons themselves, it appears to cause them to drop exactly four bones when killed. Surely there must be a use for this.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.cloak_of_agility.name": "Cloak of Agility",
  "research.afraidofthedark.cloak_of_agility.tooltip": "kiting fo' dayz",
  "research.afraidofthedark.cloak_of_agility.pre_text": "At first, I disregarded these diagrams that seemed to be nothing more than a long cloak. However, I am beginning to suspect that these witches were not fond of useless things. It must somehow be connected to the wrist crossbow, and provide yet another countermeasure to the werewolf threat. I, for one, cannot imagine what good a cloak would possibly do when compared to hardy armor, but perhaps I'm missing something.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.cloak_of_agility.text": "Mobility. That is what they were after. The wrist crossbow provides a means to actually kill the beasts, but even the strongest armor will hardly survive a single vicious werewolf attack. What good is a weapon if you aren't alive to use it? These brilliant people developed a cloak that would allow even the less agile of their kind to leap into a roll without getting hurt, allowing for an excellent way to evade the werewolves' attacks. I have recorded the steps to create such a cloak in the following pages. Perhaps with a tool like this, I can finally dare to fight the beasts.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.dark_forest.name": "Dark Forest",
  "research.afraidofthedark.dark_forest.tooltip": "cults can be fun",
  "research.afraidofthedark.dark_forest.pre_text": "One of the most striking drawings I have found in this book depicts a forest grove that looks completely otherworldly. The massive trees reach to the sky, blotting out all light to the lower places. Certainly, this place must be of some interest if the author bothered to sketch it in such detail. I'm absolutely certain I'll know it when I see it. However, I honestly can't be sure this isn't just some fantasy world. I'll keep an eye out for it nonetheless.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.dark_forest.text": "It is as mindboggling as the sketch suggested. The trees seem to grow up for eternity, and the ground turns pitch black as it seeps into the treeline. I've never been afraid of the dark, but now I'm beginning to reconsider. However, there appears to be a sort of stone structure in the center. Despite my reservations, I ought to go examine it more closely. I'm absolutely positive it was designed by the same people who made the crypt.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.silver_slayer.name": "Silver Slayer",
  "research.afraidofthedark.silver_slayer.tooltip": "slick slicing silver",
  "research.afraidofthedark.silver_slayer.pre_text": "I must refine this new type of ore to discover its properties. I hope it will turn out to be something useful.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.silver_slayer.text": "Astral Silver, as I now call it, is an incredible material that is as ductile as tempered steel, yet as hard as diamond. Surely, this could be used to make weapons of incredible strength and durability. Merely on a whim, I decided to test it against animal hide infused with fresh werewolf blood, and I was met with an incredible discovery: Astral Silver repels Vitae. Much like oil repels water, all the magical properties of werewolf skin seem to disappear when met with this material. I am more excited than I have been in a long while. This will inevitably lead to a whole new class of weapon. More importantly, it may be just what I need to fight off some of these supernatural foes.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.desert_oasis.name": "Desert Oasis",
  "research.afraidofthedark.desert_oasis.tooltip": "what is... THAT?",
  "research.afraidofthedark.desert_oasis.pre_text": "I found a new sketch in the journal today. It depicts a huge oasis in the middle of what must be a desert. I don't know of anywhere else that cacti grow, and cacti are clearly depicted in the image. More importantly, the trees depicted as growing around the oasis are massive and sprawling. They look completely different than any variety of tree I have seen before. I have read before in books about a rare tree called the mangrove. Perhaps this is what they were referring to? I'll have to find one of these oases to make sure.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.desert_oasis.text": "This place is visually striking in every way. It is a massive grove of trees and wildlife in the middle of a barren wasteland. The trees have bright white bark and bright pink innards. A tower reaches to the sky here, made by some forgotten architect. Needless to say, this place is quite the spectacle.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.eerie_forest.name": "Eerie Forest",
  "research.afraidofthedark.eerie_forest.tooltip": "ashen trees",
  "research.afraidofthedark.eerie_forest.pre_text": "There is a strange forest that somehow reminds me of that forsaken old crypt. Perhaps, like the crypt, there is something more to be found here. All of the colors in these trees seem faded, almost like something is draining the life force of the land itself. Of course, that is but poetic fantasy, but I still ought to step carefully. There are no doubt fearsome creatures that live in such a place. I must be cautious, but I also simply must explore this place.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.eerie_forest.text": "I have visited the forest, and have decided to investigate some of the strange beasts that live here. I know not what I will find, but there are a number of sketches in the journal that seem quite reminiscent of this strange forest. However, the journal also includes a drawing of what I can only assume to be a small hut. I should keep an eye out for such structures as I continue my journey. An unsettling feeling comes over me whenever I visit this place. As such, I believe I have devised a fitting name for this new type of woodlands: the Eerie Forest.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.elemental_magic.name": "Elemental Magic",
  "research.afraidofthedark.elemental_magic.tooltip": "desert sorcery",
  "research.afraidofthedark.elemental_magic.pre_text": "The people who used to live in this desert oasis were clearly practitioners of magic. They left signs of their magic all over the place, most notably in those stupid frogs. However, they must also have left at least some of their secrets behind. Surely there must be some writings here that will teach me more about magic.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.elemental_magic.text": "I dug through who knows how many chests to find it, but I found a scroll pertaining to elementary magic. Luckily it is in a language I can mostly understand, unlike the writings in my journal. It is archaic, but still quite clear. It defines the basic laws of magic, and describes how to learn to manipulate the elements.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.inferno.pre_text": "Whenever I near the throne, I feel an involuntary shudder pass through my body. There is a presence here, I can feel it. While I cannot find a single objective observation to confirm this, I know it to be true nonetheless. There is a great evil here, and I fear that this throne may be the key to awakening it.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.inferno.text": "It's her. Enaria. Oh god, what have I done. I will not go down without a fight, and, with any luck, maybe I can send her back to whatever hell she came from.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_frogs.tooltip": "froggie bacon",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_frogs.pre_text": "Okay, so, the residents of this oasis are not exactly what I expected. Whatever intelligent creatures built this place are clearly long gone. All that's left are these obnoxious, oversized, pink frogs. What's worse is that they somehow have absorbed some of the magic of this place, and are casting random spells everywhere. While these creatures are certainly of great interest to me in a scientific sense, I'm thinking I may have to engage in some... population control.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_frogs.text": "Luckily, these frogs are not difficult to kill. They seem mostly neutral towards me, although incredibly chaotic. I would probably feel bad about killing one if they weren't so annoying. It seems to have dropped something that looks like bright pink bacon. The absurdities continue. In the interest of keeping a scientific perspective, I think I will rename this substance to Magic Essence. Perhaps I can glean something of value from further study.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_skeleton.name": "Enchanted Skeleton",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_skeleton.tooltip": "great prank material",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_skeleton.pre_text": "The crypt was crawling with these strange skeleton creatures. Unlike their overworld counterparts, these new skeletons do not utilize bows, and inflict weakness and slowness upon when whenever they land a hit. They are most dangerous in large numbers, but are quite easy to defeat individually. I should collect some bones from these enchanted skeletons and see what I can learn from them.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.enchanted_skeleton.text": "These bones are far more ancient than normal skeleton bones, and possess some of the odd effects that the skeletons themselves use in combat. These Enchanted Skeletons are worthy of note, and might perhaps lead to more breakthroughs in the future.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.flask_of_souls.tooltip": "Is this worse than murder?",
  "research.afraidofthedark.flask_of_souls.pre_text": "I have devised a schematic for a device that may have incredible abilities. By using werewolf blood, I can siphon the essence of creatures I have slain into a special flask. I suspect that, using this essence in tandem with the blood's incredible regenerative properties, the flask may even allow me to revive the creature at will. However, this is all still theoretical, and I still must actually make this device. I will include my schematics below.",
  "research.afraidofthedark.flask_of_souls.text": "It works. It has no right to, but it does. I am now firmly convinced that there is something supernatural at work here. I can revive nearly any creature at will using this Flask of Souls. I can capture a being upon its death, and use it as I please. The implications of this experiment are quite terrifying, but in the name of science and of discovery, I must press on.",

  "research.afraidofthedark.forbidden_city.tooltip": "adventurer beware",
  "research.afraidofthedark.forbidden_city.pre_text": "This is by far the most referenced structure in the previous owner's notes. It is a massive spiral staircase leading deep underground.

When I first encounter one, it accumulates smaller pieces of that same reddish metal and levitates each of them in an orbit around themselves. These metal splinters provide an excellent defense mechanism, and makes the drones very difficult to disable. This giant underground city has proven to be just as dangerous as I had thought.
